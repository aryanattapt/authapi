# Auth API

This repository contains a simple authentication API built using Go. The API supports user signup and signin functionalities, utilizing JWT for session management and MongoDB for data storage.

## Structure of the Service

The service is structured as follows:
### Components:

- **controller:** Contains HTTP handler functions for managing requests and responses.
- **model:** Defines the data structures for users and request payloads.
- **repository:** Handles data operations with MongoDB.
- **service:** Contains business logic for signing up and signing in users.
- **utils:** Provides utility functions, including password hashing, JWT token generation and others.
- **route:** Defines the API routes mapping HTTP methods and endpoints to their corresponding controller functions, thereby facilitating structured and RESTful interactions within the application.
- **test:** Provides a suite of automated tests designed to validate the functionality and reliability of the application components
